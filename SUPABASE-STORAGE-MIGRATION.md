# Supabase Storage Migration - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully migrated menu item and add-on image management from local filesystem to Supabase Storage.

## What Changed

### 1. **New Storage Utility** (`src/lib/storage.ts`)
Created comprehensive storage utilities:
- `uploadImage()` - Upload files to Supabase Storage
- `deleteImage()` - Delete files from Supabase Storage
- `replaceImage()` - Replace old image with new one
- `extractStoragePath()` - Extract storage path from URL
- `isSupabaseUrl()` - Check if path is Supabase URL
- `isLocalPath()` - Check if path is local filesystem path

### 2. **Updated Upload API** (`src/app/api/upload/route.ts`)
- Now uploads to Supabase Storage bucket `menu-images`
- Added file type validation (images only)
- Added file size validation (10MB max)
- Returns public URL from Supabase CDN
- Removed filesystem operations

### 3. **Updated Menu Service** (`src/services/menuService.ts`)
Enhanced both `menuItemService` and `addonService`:

#### Delete Operations
- Automatically deletes associated images from Supabase Storage when items are deleted
- Only deletes Supabase URLs (backwards compatible with old local paths)

#### Update Operations
- When image is updated, automatically deletes old image from storage
- Prevents orphaned images in storage
- Only affects Supabase URLs

### 4. **Updated ImageUpload Component** (`src/components/admin/menu/ImageUpload.tsx`)
- Better error handling and messaging
- Validates response data

## Supabase Storage Configuration

### Bucket: `menu-images`
- **Visibility**: Public
- **Folder Structure**:
  - `menu-item/` - Menu item images
  - `add-ons/` - Add-on images

### Storage Policies Created:
1. **Public read access** - SELECT for `public` role
2. **Authenticated upload** - INSERT for `authenticated` role
3. **Authenticated update** - UPDATE for `authenticated` role
4. **Authenticated delete** - DELETE for `authenticated` role

## Migration Strategy

### Clean Slate Approach ✅
- New uploads go directly to Supabase Storage
- Existing local images remain functional
- No data loss or downtime
- Gradual migration as images are updated

### Backwards Compatibility
The system supports both:
- ✅ New Supabase URLs: `https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/menu-images/...`
- ✅ Old local paths: `/images/menu/menu-item/...`

Helper functions (`isSupabaseUrl()`, `isLocalPath()`) distinguish between them.

## How It Works

### Upload Flow:
1. User selects image in admin panel
2. `ImageUpload` component sends file to `/api/upload`
3. API validates file (type, size)
4. File uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket
5. Public URL returned and saved to database

### Update Flow (Image Replacement):
1. User uploads new image for existing item
2. New image uploaded to Supabase
3. Database updated with new URL
4. Old image automatically deleted from storage (if it's a Supabase URL)

### Delete Flow:
1. User deletes menu item/addon
2. Item deleted from database
3. Associated image automatically deleted from Supabase Storage (if it's a Supabase URL)

## Benefits

✅ **No Git Bloat** - Images not stored in repository
✅ **CDN Delivery** - Fast global image delivery via Supabase CDN
✅ **Scalability** - No server disk usage for images
✅ **Automatic Cleanup** - Orphaned images automatically deleted
✅ **Access Control** - Proper authentication for uploads/deletes
✅ **Image Optimization** - Can leverage Supabase image transformations
✅ **Backwards Compatible** - Works with existing local images

## Testing Checklist

Before going to production, test:

- [ ] Upload new menu item with image
- [ ] Upload new addon with image
- [ ] Update menu item image (verify old image deleted)
- [ ] Update addon image (verify old image deleted)
- [ ] Delete menu item (verify image deleted from storage)
- [ ] Delete addon (verify image deleted from storage)
- [ ] Verify images display correctly on public menu page
- [ ] Test file size limit (>10MB should fail)
- [ ] Test invalid file types (non-images should fail)
- [ ] Check Supabase Storage dashboard to verify uploads/deletes

## Monitoring

### Check Storage Usage
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → menu-images
2. Monitor file count and total size
3. Verify no orphaned files accumulating

### Logs
- Upload errors: Check browser console and API logs
- Delete errors: Check server console (non-blocking warnings)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. The old `/api/upload/route.ts` code is replaced but can be restored from git history
2. Existing local images will continue working
3. Database stores URLs - can switch between local/Supabase URLs if needed

## Security Notes

✅ **Public Read** - Required for displaying images on website
✅ **Authenticated Write** - Only logged-in admins can upload
✅ **Authenticated Delete** - Only logged-in admins can delete
✅ **File Validation** - Type and size checks prevent abuse
✅ **No Anonymous Uploads** - Prevents spam/abuse

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://jhugrvpaizlzeemazuna.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Already configured in `src/lib/supabase.ts`.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test in development environment
2. ⏳ Test all upload/update/delete flows
3. ⏳ Deploy to production
4. ⏳ Monitor for any issues
5. ⏳ Eventually migrate old local images if desired

## Support

For issues:
- Check Supabase Dashboard → Storage → menu-images for uploads
- Check browser console for upload errors
- Check server logs for delete warnings
- Verify storage policies are active
